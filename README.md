I was given the task to make a quiz for this weeks homework. When you click the start button you will be taken to the first question. After you answer, you be be directed to following question until there are no more. 
This quiz has a total of 4 questions. 

You will be scored by your final time in the upper right hand corner. If you answer the question wrong, you will have 15 seconds decducted. If you answer correctly, you will have 10 seconds added. Whatever your final time is is your score. If you do not answer all the question in the 75 seconds given, the quiz will end.

Once the quiz is over or you have asnwered all the questions, you will be shown your score and asked to enter your initials. Once you submit you wil be shown your score with your initials next to it. You have the option to go back to take th quiz again or clear your high scores.
